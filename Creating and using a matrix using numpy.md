1. First we will create normal Python Lists, we will then create our matrix using the lists.
```py
#Points
KobeBryant_PTS = [2832,2430,2323,2201,1970,2078,1616,2133,83,782]
JoeJohnson_PTS = [1653,1426,1779,1688,1619,1312,1129,1170,1245,1154]
LeBronJames_PTS = [2478,2132,2250,2304,2258,2111,1683,2036,2089,1743]
CarmeloAnthony_PTS = [2122,1881,1978,1504,1943,1970,1245,1920,2112,966]
DwightHoward_PTS = [1292,1443,1695,1624,1503,1784,1113,1296,1297,646]
ChrisBosh_PTS = [1572,1561,1496,1746,1678,1438,1025,1232,1281,928]
ChrisPaul_PTS = [1258,1104,1684,1781,841,1268,1189,1186,1185,1564]
KevinDurant_PTS = [903,903,1624,1871,2472,2161,1850,2280,2593,686]
DerrickRose_PTS = [597,597,597,1361,1619,2026,852,0,159,904]
DwayneWade_PTS = [2040,1397,1254,2386,2045,1941,1082,1463,1028,1331]
#Matrix
Points = np.array([KobeBryant_PTS, JoeJohnson_PTS, LeBronJames_PTS, CarmeloAnthony_PTS, DwightHoward_PTS, ChrisBosh_PTS, ChrisPaul_PTS, KevinDurant_PTS, DerrickRose_PTS, DwayneWade_PTS])        
```

2. Below is our test data
```py
#Games 
KobeBryant_G = [80,77,82,82,73,82,58,78,6,35]
JoeJohnson_G = [82,57,82,79,76,72,60,72,79,80]
LeBronJames_G = [79,78,75,81,76,79,62,76,77,69]
CarmeloAnthony_G = [80,65,77,66,69,77,55,67,77,40]
DwightHoward_G = [82,82,82,79,82,78,54,76,71,41]
ChrisBosh_G = [70,69,67,77,70,77,57,74,79,44]
ChrisPaul_G = [78,64,80,78,45,80,60,70,62,82]
KevinDurant_G = [35,35,80,74,82,78,66,81,81,27]
DerrickRose_G = [40,40,40,81,78,81,39,0,10,51]
DwayneWade_G = [75,51,51,79,77,76,49,69,54,62]
#Matrix
Games = np.array([KobeBryant_G, JoeJohnson_G, LeBronJames_G, CarmeloAnthony_G, DwightHoward_G, ChrisBosh_G, ChrisPaul_G, KevinDurant_G, DerrickRose_G, DwayneWade_G])

#Field Goals
KobeBryant_FG = [978,813,775,800,716,740,574,738,31,266]
JoeJohnson_FG = [632,536,647,620,635,514,423,445,462,446]
LeBronJames_FG = [875,772,794,789,768,758,621,765,767,624]
CarmeloAnthony_FG = [756,691,728,535,688,684,441,669,743,358]
DwightHoward_FG = [468,526,583,560,510,619,416,470,473,251]
ChrisBosh_FG = [549,543,507,615,600,524,393,485,492,343]
ChrisPaul_FG = [407,381,630,631,314,430,425,412,406,568]
KevinDurant_FG = [306,306,587,661,794,711,643,731,849,238]
DerrickRose_FG = [208,208,208,574,672,711,302,0,58,338]
DwayneWade_FG = [699,472,439,854,719,692,416,569,415,509]
#Matrix
FieldGoals  = np.array([KobeBryant_FG, JoeJohnson_FG, LeBronJames_FG, CarmeloAnthony_FG, DwightHoward_FG, ChrisBosh_FG, ChrisPaul_FG, KevinDurant_FG, DerrickRose_FG, DwayneWade_FG])
```
3. If we want to find the avg field goals per game for each player
```py
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

//if we do not make that import, the calculaton will fail as we are divdiing 0 by 0 in one of the instances within the two matrices
//As long as our data is in the correct order and our Matrices share the same size, finding FGs per game is quite easy.
np.matrix.round(FieldGoals / Games)
```
