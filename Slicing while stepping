1. We can slice and step at the same time


# The code below will return elements 1-8 non inclusive  to the eighth element, and instead of printing every element, we have specified 
# only to target every other. Notice the 2 in "[1:8:2]"
letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K']

for i in letters[1:8:2]:
    print(i)
